# Catalyst Photo Grid

Simple Catalyst example (Mac idiom) of a grid-based app populated with photos that can animate its cells between two different layouts (in this case, aspect ratio). It also demonstrates custom keyboard focus presentation, and supports multi-select via dragging.

The sample images are taken from Apple's [Fruta sample project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui).
